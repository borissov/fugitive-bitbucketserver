# fugitive-bitbucketserver

## set your bitbucket server urls

```viml
let g:fugitive_bitbucketservers_domains = ['http://yoururl.com'] 
```
If your server URL includes a port as well as the hostname e.g. http://yoururl.com:7990 then just the hostname should be configured, don't include the ":7990".
